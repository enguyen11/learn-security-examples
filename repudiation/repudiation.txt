- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

In insecure.js, it gets and posts the messages and displays who sent the message but in this file, it does not keep
track of who and when an action was taken. In secure.js we address this by keeping a log file to keep track of every
action taken while logged in. We should make the log file hidden so it would be more difficult for unauthorized users to
find. We should also keep multiple copies so we have backups if it gets lost or corrupted.
