Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
Which CIA property does info disclosure violate?
What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

The vulnerability is it leaks personal or private information by putting the user entered values in the url.
The secure version addresses this by replacing the non-alphanumeric values. This violates the confidentiality property
because it personal or private information in the url and nonauthorized users can view and use this information.
You can address this problem implementing a caesar cipher to shift the values.
