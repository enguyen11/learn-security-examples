Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

In the insecure version, it provides some protection by hiding everything behind a session id.
However, this is also the vulnerability because the id is not configured correctly. A malicious user can
use the session id generated in insecure.js to login as an existing user. In secure.js we make the
session id unreadable so the attacker can't use that session id. This violates Confidentiality in CIA because
users other than the authorized user can gain access.
