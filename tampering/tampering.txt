Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the
vulnerability.
Which CIA property does tampering violate?

In the insecure.js file, we render the user name assuming it is a string not code. In secure.js we use
a function called escapeHTML to replace special characters in the input
with its string equivalent to convert the script into a string.
This violates integrity because the program tries to render a
string but is instead used to execute a script which was not its intended purpose.
